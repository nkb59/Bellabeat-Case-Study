The Business Task:

As a data analyst on Bellabeat's marketing analytics team, I will be analyzing how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. By identifying how the trends and relationships in the existing data can be applied to Bellabeat customers, I will make high-level recommendations for our marketing strategies to our key stakeholders.
